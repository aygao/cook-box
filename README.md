# cook-box

Cook Box is a recipe manager that was modeled after traditional family cookbooks. It was inspired by the developer's wish to store personal recipes digitally for easy access and to be able to brainstorm weekly meal ideas faster. The webapp is a no-frills modern cookbook designed with the concept of recipe cards stored inside a recipe box.
